# Speech-recognition-using-RNN-and-SGD-optimizer
The project implements speech recognition using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). It involves converting audio files into spectrograms, preprocessing data for training, and applying RNN-based models to identify speech patterns from the processed audio inputs.
